# TempDependent_Predation_Model
Contains data, modeling functions, and analysis used to fit and simulate stage-dependent predator-prey interactions under varying temperatures.

Files in Folder 1 pertain to fitting temperature-dependent models of prey development and prey mortality rates for Aedes atropalpus larvae.

Files in Folder 2 pertain to fitting temperature-dependent functional responses for two predators, Erythemis simplicicollis and Pachydiplax longipennis, feeding on Aedes atropalpus larvae.

Files in Folder 3 unite the two models above into a stage-dependent model of prey survival from hatch to adulthood in the presence of one of the above species of predator, as a function of temperature.

Relevant functions for fitting each of the above models can be found in ModelingFunctions.R.
